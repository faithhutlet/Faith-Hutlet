# __Three Things About Myself:__
- For my career right now, I am working as an assistant manager at a retail store. This is my first ever university program!
- I manage some of the social media at my current job, which is what interested me to learn more and learn more of the background to how it all comes together. 
- I don't really have experience with a whole lot of technology or programs besides the basic day to day use.
